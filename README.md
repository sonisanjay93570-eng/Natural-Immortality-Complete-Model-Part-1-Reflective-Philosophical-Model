This model is entirely based on nature and wisdom principles.
2️⃣ Source of Immortality
The true source of natural immortality lies in nature itself. Key elements include:
Clean air and water – essential for the balanced function of body and energy flow
Natural nutrition – fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and plant elements provide the body with natural energy and nutrients
Sunlight and seasonal cycles – natural light and temperature maintain vitality
Natural cycles and relationships – connection with plants, animals, and environment supports consciousness and well-being
In simple words: the elements and balance inherent in nature are the true nectar of life (Amrit).
3️⃣ Balance of Body and Consciousness
Every organ and cell remains healthy and long-lived only when energy flow is natural and balanced.
Mental balance and wisdom are essential for experiencing immortality.
Imbalance, greed, or overexertion exhausts both body and consciousness, negatively affecting health and longevity.
4️⃣ Natural Life Cycle
Nature maintains life in a balanced cycle:

Birth → Growth → Energy Accumulation → Healthy Life → Death
Natural immortality means maintaining balance within this cycle, not merely increasing length or strength.
Each stage contributes to long-term health and vitality.

When humans maintain their thoughts, actions, and consciousness according to nature's laws,
Life becomes healthy, enduring, and close to natural immortality.
Greed, excess, or violation of natural rules leads to imbalance and deterioration.

Science and machines have accelerated life’s pace, but cannot create true natural immortality.
Technological convenience provides only temporary benefit, without sustaining energy flow and balance.
Therefore, true immortality can only be achieved through natural laws and wise living.
